# Machine-Learning-Projects
ML projects developed during Artificial Intelligence course and Probability Methods in ML course.
Projects list:
- Breast Cancer Detection <br>
  Implemented logistic regression and naive bayesian classificator to compare results.
- Cat generator <br>
  Generates cats faces using Generative Adversarial Networks.
- Fraud Detection (SOM) <br>
   This project helps in finding out which bank clients provided fake data while applying for loan.
   ML technique used here are Self-Organizing Maps.
- Fraud Detection (Autoencoder) <br>
  Algorithm detects which bank transactions were fraudulent using autoencoder written in PyTorch.
- Fruit Recognition <br>
  Implemented neural network using Keras and TensorFlow. It consists convolutional, pooling and fully-connected layers and additionally transfer-learning and fine tuning methods.
- IMDB Classification <br>
  Classifies movies reviews using MLP and LSTM neutral networks.
- K-means vs DBSCAN <br>
  Generates datasets to show differences between K-means and DBSCAN data clustering algorithms.
- MNIST <br>
  Number recognition using neural network developed from scratch, with fully-connected layers and backpropagation.
- Multiple Linear Regression <br>
  Implementation of multiple linear regression algorithm with square error function, regularization and different base functions.
